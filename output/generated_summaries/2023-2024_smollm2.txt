The Spanish government allocated 2520 million euros for higher education in the academic year 2023-2024. The budget is divided into two main programs: university programs and non-university programs. University programs include courses leading to official degree titles and complementary training for access to universities. Non-university programs encompass various secondary school qualifications, professional development courses, religious studies, language courses offered by public administration bodies, preparatory courses for entrance exams, formativos degrees, and other specialized fields.

Scholarships consist of tuition coverage, fixed income per year, residency stipends, and grants based on GPA levels. The scholarship structure varies depending on GPA ranges from 8,00 to 8,49 points to 9,00 or more points. Basic grants cover basic cycle credits, while variable minimums apply.

The application period starts on March 27, 2023, and ends on May 17, 2023, with an exception until December 31, 2023.
