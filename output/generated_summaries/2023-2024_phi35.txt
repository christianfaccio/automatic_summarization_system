The Spanish higher education budget for the 2023-2024 academic year is set at €2.52 billion under Regulation No. 117/2023 from February 21st. The funding covers various educational programs including university degrees leading to official titles of both graduate and master levels as well as specialized courses aimed at mature individuals over 25 years old seeking access into public institutions.
