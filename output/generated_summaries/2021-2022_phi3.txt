The programs funded by this regulation include university degrees leading to official titles as well as master’s courses; specialized training courses aiming at access or title acquisition with credits awarded upon completion; various forms of secondary school teaching ranging from general studies up to religious instruction; professional arts and sports educational tracks alongside advanced levels of these disciplines; language learning within state schools intended primarily for adult learners seeking employment opportunities abroad; entry level coursework designed to prepare candidates for formal admission into their respective fields along with additional supportive study sessions tailored towards examination readiness; plus basic vocational qualifications that provide foundational skills across multiple industries without specific degree prerequisites. Scholarships offered cover tuition fees entirely through public funds while also providing residency allowances amounting to approximately $1600 annually per student coupled with variable minimum stipends starting at around $60 monthly depending on performance metrics such as GPA ranges where excellence is rewarded incrementally—from moderate achievements ($50) all the way to exceptional ones ($125), supplemented furthermore by fixed grants worth
