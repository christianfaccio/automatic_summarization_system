The Spanish education system for the fiscal year of 2025-2026 is governed by Regulation No. 1721/2007 with respect to its budget allocation amounting to €12.345 billion. The programs under this regulation include university degrees in higher arts ('Enseñanzas artísticas superiores') as well as professional training courses leading up to official degree titles at both master's level and below. Non-degree offerings such as secondary school cycles ('Primero y Segundo Ciclo del Bachillerato'), vocational qualifications from medium to advanced levels including sports studies and religious instruction also fall within these educational initiatives. Furthermore, language learning opportunities provided through state examination systems complement other curricular areas like specialized access coursework tailored towards specific trades. Scholarships offered during this time frame cover tuition fees via public funds while providing fixed income grants ranging between €1,700 and €2,700 depending on residency status; excellence students receive additional financial support based upon GPA scores—€50 increments per grade point beyond eighty percentile marks starting at €125 for top achievers above ninety five percentiles. Basic grant amounts stand firmly set at €300 but increase slightly when applied toward basic cycle subjects reaching €350 respectively. A variable minimum fee component
