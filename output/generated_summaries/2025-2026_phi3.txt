The Academic Year Program for the fiscal year of 2025-2026 is governed by Regulation No. 163/2025 dated March 4th under which various educational programs have been outlined across both university and non-university sectors in Spain. University students can pursue higher arts degrees ('Enseñanzas artísticas superiores'), official graduate titles with Master's credits or access courses overseen by public fees that cover tuition costs entirely. Non-university participants include those engaged in secondary education levels such as first and second cycles of Bachelor’s degree studies; professional training at medium to upper vocational level including sports instruction; religious seminary studies; language learning within state schools offering certification; entrance tests prep courses along with basic cycle formative stages also financed through public funds. Scholarships provided during this program offer fixed income amounts ranging from €1,700 to €2,700 based on residency status alongside variable minimum earnings starting at €60 annually. A base grant of either €300 or €350 applies depending on whether one opts for a standard course versus specialized ones like medicine or law requiring additional resources. Entry prerequisites stipulate completion of no less than 60 credit hours coupled with maintaining a GPA threshold above 5.0 throughout their study tenure
