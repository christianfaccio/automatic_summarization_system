The Spanish government's educational budget for the fiscal year of 2022-2023 is set at €1600 million under Regulation RD 154/2022 from February 22nd. The funding supports various programs across university education—including degree courses leading to official titles and master’s level training with additional complementary formation options such as professional higher arts or sports teaching degrees; non-university institutions like basic cycle schools offering general studies in languages taught by state entities; religious seminaries providing advanced study opportunities; alongside scholarships that cover tuition fees through public funds.

Financial aid includes fixed income grants up to €1700 monthly depending on residency status, variable support starting at €60 per student based on need assessment criteria, along with supplemental benefits tied directly to scholastic performance measured via Grade Point Average (GPA), ranging between increments of €50 corresponding to specific score ranges ending at €125 for scores exceeding 9.50. Basic grant eligibility varies according to students engaged in either fulltime or part-time cycles, amounting respectively to €300 and €
